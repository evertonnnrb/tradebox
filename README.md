# TradeBox

Welcome to TradeBox! This is an entry-level project created by me to explore Spring Boot, Maven, Web development, JPA, and Lombok. ðŸš€

## Overview

TradeBox is a simple trade management system developed as part of my learning journey. While it's a basic implementation, it demonstrates my understanding of fundamental concepts in Spring Boot and related technologies.

## Features

- **Trade Operations**: Perform basic trade operations like creating, updating, and viewing trades.
- **Maven Project**: Built using Maven for dependency management and project structuring.
- **Web Development**: Utilizes Spring Boot's web functionalities to handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **JPA (Java Persistence API)**: Implements JPA for easy database management and interaction.
- **Lombok**: Employs Lombok annotations to minimize boilerplate code and enhance readability.

## Getting Started

To run TradeBox locally:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/everton.nnrb/tradebox.git`
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.).
3. Ensure you have Java and Maven installed.
5. Run the application: `java -jar target/tradebox-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`
6. Build and run the application.

Please refer to the comments in the code for any additional setup or configuration requirements.

## Next Steps

- **Improvements**: I plan to enhance this project by adding more features, refining the user interface, and optimizing code.
- **Learning Path**: Continuously learning and implementing advanced Spring Boot functionalities and exploring more Java libraries and frameworks.
